            <h2 class="section description">Description</h2>
            <p>This chocolate cake is absolutely thee best we have ever had. It is so moist and rich, I never make anything else (unless I am short on time) The frosting recipe included goes perfectly with this cake, but you can use any frosting you like. Try this once and you'll see why I call it "The Only Chocolate Cake Recipe You'll Ever Need"!! I want to note that I recently used sweetened whipped heavy cream with vanilla and it was just as fabulous as the frosting recipe listed, plus much easier. I also used hazelnut coffee in the cake and it added even more of a little extra something!</p>

            <h2 class="section ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>

                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
                    <h4 class="h4">Frosting</h4>
                <li>1 cup milk</li>
                <li>5 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
                <li>1/2 cup shortening</li>
                <li>1 cup sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section directions">Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 325Â°F.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, sift together dry ingredients.</li>
                <li>Add oil, coffee and milk and mix at medium speed for 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add eggs and vanilla and beat 2 more minutes. Expect batter to be thin.</li>
                <li>Pour into a 9" x 13" greased and floured pan or 2- 9" round pans.</li>
                <li>Bake 9 x 13 pan for about 45 minutes or 9" pans for about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Cool in pans for about 15 minutes and then cool completely on racks.</li>
                <li>While cake is cooling make the icing: Combine the milk and flour in a saucepan and cook over low heat until thick, whisking constantly. Cover and refrigerate until chilled.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, beat butter, shortening, sugar and vanilla until creamy. Add chilled milk and flour mixture and beat for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Frost cooled cake and enjoy! The frosting sounds intimidating, but it is worth it!</li>
            </ol>

            <p>By the way, for some reason, we prefer this cake chilled, right out of the refrigerator. The rich chocolate and cool frosting just seem to taste best this way.</p>
