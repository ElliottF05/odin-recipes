        <p>My kids will give up a steak dinner for this spaghetti. It is a recipe I have been perfecting for years and it is so good (if I may humbly say) that my kids are disappointed when they eat spaghetti anywhere else but home! In fact they tell me I should open a restaurant and serve only this spaghetti and garlic bread. Thanks to all of you who have tried my recipe and have written a review. I read and appreciate every one of them!</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs Italian sausage, casings removed (mild or hot)</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped (optional)</li>
            <li>3-4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2 cups water (for a long period of simmering for flavors to meld. If you don't want to simmer it as long, add less)</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons basil</li>
            <li>teaspoons dried parsley flakes</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon fresh coarse ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup red wine (a good Cabernet!)</li>
            <li>1 lb thin spaghetti</li>
            <li>parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In large, heavy stockpot, brown Italian sausage, breaking up as you stir.</li>
            <li>Add onions and continue to cook, stirring occasionally until onions are softened.</li>
            <li>Add garlic, tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce and water.</li>
            <li>Add basil, parsley, brown sugar, salt, crushed red pepper, and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Stir well and barely bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Stir in red wine.</li>
            <li>Simmer on low, stirring frequently for at least an hour. A longer simmer makes for a better sauce, just be careful not to let it burn!</li>
            <li>Cook spaghetti according to package directions.</li>
            <li>Spoon sauce over drained spaghetti noodles and sprinkle with parmesan cheese.</li>
        </ol>
